## Admin Commands

### Prefix Management
*   **Add a Prefix:**
    ```bash
    /prefix add @<playerIndex> <text>
    ```
    *Example:* `/prefix add @2 Admin` — Assigns a bracketed visual title to a player in chat.
*   **Remove a Prefix:**
    ```bash
    /prefix remove @<playerIndex>
    ```
    *Example:* `/prefix remove @2` — Strips the title and safely deallocates the string memory from the server.

> **Note:** Administrative tools and commands are dynamically filtered out of `/help` and hidden from regular users who lack permission[cite: 2].
